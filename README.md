# Emotion-Detection-Using-ECG-Sensor-and-Machine-learning  
The suggested project seeks to develop a real-time emotion identification system 
using a Raspberry Pi computer and an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The 
system's objective is to monitor and analyze changes in ECG signals in order to 
categorize them into happy and sad signals. The hardware of the system consists of 
ECG sensors and an ADC connected to a Raspberry Pi for signal collecting. The 
ECG sensors capture the electrical activity of the heart and convert it into analogue 
signals. These analogue impulses are subsequently transformed into digital signals by 
the ADC so they can undergo further processing. Using machine learning techniques 
for emotion identification, important properties are extracted from the pre-processed 
data using feature extraction. The machine learning algorithms used for emotion 
categorization are then fed the features that were obtained. Due to the high accuracy 
and effectiveness of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, it is used in the 
proposed system. A dataset of ECG signals from several people who were each 
experiencing two emotions, such as happiness and sadness, was used to train the 
SVM classifier. The accuracy of the system is evaluated by experiments on the 
collected dataset. The results indicate a promising degree of competence in accurately 
classifying emotional states. The experiment demonstrates how emotions may be 
deduced from electrocardiogram (ECG) information, which has significant potential 
implications in a number of fields, including health and communication between 
humans and computers. The suggested system is suitable for a wide range of uses, 
such affective computing and monitoring mental health, due to its real-time emotion 
detection capabilities. The proposed research provides a novel approach for real-time 
emotion recognition using ECG signals and the Raspberry Pi. The system's 
acquisition of signals capabilities is improved with the addition of an ADC, while the 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier achieves high accuracy in emotion 
classification. The project's findings demonstrate the potential of using ECG signals 
to identify emotions and present fresh research directions.

# Problem statement:
Emotional states can be difficult to detect and interpret accurately. Current 
methods for emotion detection rely on subjective self-reporting or external 
observations, which can be unreliable and imprecise. In this project, we aim to 
develop a system for emotion detection using an ECG sensor, Analog-toDigital Converter (ADC), and Raspberry Pi. The goal is to capture the 
electrical activity of the heart using the ECG sensor, process the data using the 
ADC, and analyze it using the Raspberry Pi to accurately detect the emotional 
state of the user. This system can have various applications, such as monitoring 
mental health or providing feedback for virtual reality experiences.
